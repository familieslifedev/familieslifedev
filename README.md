- 👋 Hi, I’m @familieslifedev
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, memes, video games, music and the gym.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL - still level noob 😅, and I'm also trying to get to grips with the building blocks of websites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of easy first issues that I could dip my hand in - promise I'll try not to break it 🙃
- 📫 How to reach me - for any business inquiries please email me using the button on my website (wip)
