#### 🧩 A Little About Me:
- **Curious by Nature** 🌱 – I’m diving into **SQL** and unravelling the magic of web dev from the ground up. Currently on my "noob" arc, but we all start somewhere, right? 😅
- **Powered by Passion** 🎮 – Coding, memes, gaming, music, and gym vibes keep me thriving. Just here to make life fun and the internet cooler.
  
#### 💞 Ready to Collaborate:
I’m here for any *first issues* you’ve got that could use a fresh touch. And don’t worry – I come with a promise not to break things… too much 🙃.
